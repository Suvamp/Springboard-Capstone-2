### **1. Data**

The dataset is from the UCI MAchine Learning Reppository. The dataset is real and authentic. It wass prepared using real data from socio-economic data from 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crimedata from the 1995 FBI UCR [13].
UCI Machine Learning Repository contains free datasets which can be used by anyone trying to hone their Machine Learning/Data Science skills. The dataset was originally acquired from Kaggle (another website which hosts Machine Learning competitions) and was cleaned through the various steps of the Capstone.
This dataset contains a total number of 147 attributes and 2216 instances.
For the purpposes of the Capstone, only 15 of the attributes were used to see which variable performed as the best predictor of crime rates across the US.
